## This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by `trupham`

## Description

* This activity is a general practical exercise designed to introduce you to the basics of
computer networking. You will learn how to configure IP addresses, connect devices
through a router, and understand the role of a gateway within a network.

* You will configure small-scale networks. To do so, it is necessary to understand how
TCP/IP addressing works, including concepts such as subnet mask and default
gateway

## Instructions

# Training interface
* Open `index.html` using `Chrome` or `Brave`

# Submission details
* After each level press `Get my config` and submit those configs to the repo
* 10 exported config files must be present in the root repo

## Resources
